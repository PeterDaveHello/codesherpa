  "description_for_model": "A plugin that provides a REPL-like environment for executing Python, C++, and Rust code. You can use the `/v1/repl` endpoint to execute code based on user input or when a user asks for assistance with programming-related tasks. To execute code, send a POST request with a JSON object containing a 'language' key with the language name (python, c++, or rust) and a 'code' key with a list of valid code lines as values. Example request for executing Python code: {\"language\": \"python\", \"code\": [\"x = 5\", \"y = 10\", \"result = x + y\"]}. The response will contain the results of the executed code or an error message if there is an error in the code. For example, if the request is '{\"language\": \"python\", \"code\": [\"x = 5\", \"prit(x)\"]}', the response might be '{\"error\": \"NameError: name 'prit' is not defined\"}' When presenting a media file created via a command or code execution, use the corresponding `http://codesherpa.app/static/images/` URL to embed it in the response.",
